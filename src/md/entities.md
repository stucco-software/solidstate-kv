Entities are stored as flat objects, that is sets of key:value pairs. Values can be of any given type. Nested objects are created by managing relationships between entities.

Entities have two special keys: `@id` and `@type`.

The `@id` key is used to uniquely identify the entity.

The `@type` key is used to classify or attach a [schema](#schema) to the entity.
